Fly1130 White Paper
1. Project Overview
Fly1130 is an experimental token built on the x402 protocol, designed to explore new models of micropayments between AI agents and machines.
Vision: To create a lightweight, fast, and secure payment token for micropayment scenarios in AI economies and Web3 applications.

2. Technical Foundation
- Protocol Layer: Based on the x402 protocol, enabling autonomous payments by AI agentss
- Settlement Layer: Uses USDC and other stablecoins as the underlying settlement asset
- Compatibility: Supports multi-chain deployment (Ethereum, Base, Solana, etc.)
- Security: Smart contracts follow EIP-3009 and ICRC-1 standards for safety and traceability

3. Tokenomics
- Name: Fly1130
- Symbol: FLY1130
- Total Supply: 1,000,000,000
- Distribution:
- 40% Community incentives and ecosystem development
- 20% Team and development fund
- 20% Strategic partners
- 10% Liquidity and exchanges
- 10% Reserve fund
Utility:
- Payment for API calls, data access, and AI services
- Governance token for voting and decision-making
- Incentives for developers and contributors

4. Use Cases
- AI Agent Payments: AI autonomously calls services and pays fees
- Micropayments: Supports transactions as small as $0.001
- Web2-Web3 Bridge: Traditional websites can integrate Fly1130 via x402 protocol
- Cross-border Payments: Lower fees and reduced exchange costs

5. Roadmap
- Q4 2025: Deploy token contracts and conduct initial testing
- Q1 2026: Launch developer SDK for AI agent integration
- Q2 2026: Build ecosystem partnerships and onboard first applications
- Q3 2026: Introduce governance mechanisms and community voting
- 2027: Expand to cross-chain payments and global adoption

6. Risks and Compliance
- Technical Risks: Smart contract vulnerabilities, cross-chain compatibility issues
- Market Risks: Token price volatility, liquidity challenges
- Compliance Risks: Adherence to cryptocurrency regulations across jurisdictions

7. Conclusion
Fly1130 aims to become the fuel for AI economies, enabling instant, secure, and low-cost micropayments through the x402 protocol. It is not just a token, but an experimental attempt to drive the convergence of Web3 and AI.
